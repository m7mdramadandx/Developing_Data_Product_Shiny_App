## Context

We show the relationship of the miles per galon with he weight and cylinder of the car.

## Data

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

```{r data, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(corrplot)

data(mtcars)
```

## Why we chose those factors

We made a correlation matrix with all the factor and took the ones who have high correlation to the mpg factor. 

```{r corratrix, echo=FALSE}
carCorr <- cor(mtcars[sapply(mtcars,is.numeric)])
corrplot(carCorr, method="number", order="hclust", col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))
```


## The plot

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt, color = ~cyl, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```
